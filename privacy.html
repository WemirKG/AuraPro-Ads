              <h2>2) Information We Collect</h2>

              <h3 class="privacy-h3">A) Information you provide</h3>
              <p>
                When you submit an intake request, you may provide:
              </p>
              <ul class="privacy-list">
                <li><strong>Contact details:</strong> name, email address</li>
                <li><strong>Business details:</strong> business/brand name, website or social link</li>
                <li><strong>Project details:</strong> selected package, campaign goal, desired launch date, and any notes you type in the message fields</li>
                <li><strong>Consent preferences:</strong> whether you gave permission for project emails and (if offered) marketing emails</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 class="privacy-h3">B) Information collected automatically</h3>
              <p>
                Like most websites, our hosting and service providers may automatically collect limited technical data such as:
                device type, browser type, approximate location (derived from IP address), and usage events (pages visited, timestamps).
                This data helps operate and secure the site.
              </p>

              <h3 class="privacy-h3">C) Payment information</h3>
              <p>
                Payments are processed by third-party payment providers (for example, PayPal). We do not store full payment card
                numbers on our servers. Your payment provider may share limited transaction details with us (such as confirmation,
                payer name, email, status, and transaction ID) so we can fulfill your order.
              </p>

                <strong>We do not sell your personal information.</strong>

                <li><strong>Provide services</strong> (review your request, produce deliverables, deliver files)</li>
                <li><strong>Communicate</strong> (updates, clarifications, delivery, customer support)</li>
                <li><strong>Process and verify orders</strong> (confirm payment, prevent fraud)</li>
                <li><strong>Improve and protect</strong> the website (security, debugging, analytics where used)</li>
                <li><strong>Comply with legal obligations</strong> (tax, accounting, lawful requests)</li>

              <h2>4) Email & Consent</h2>

              <h3 class="privacy-h3">A) Project (transactional) emails</h3>
              <p>
                If you submit an intake request, we will email you about that request. These are “transactional” emails and may include:
                order confirmation, project questions, delivery links, revision questions (if applicable), and support messages.
              </p>

              <h3 class="privacy-h3">B) Marketing emails</h3>
              <p>
                We will only send promotional emails (offers, creative tips, product updates) if you explicitly opt in where presented.
                You can unsubscribe at any time using the link included in marketing emails or by contacting us.

                To keep your experience consistent, your consent preferences may be stored with your intake record.

            <section class="privacy-section" id="share">
              <h2>5) Sharing & Service Providers</h2>
              <p>
                We may share information with trusted service providers who help us run the business. These providers only receive the
                information needed to perform their services.
              </p>

              <ul class="privacy-list">
                <li><strong>Form processing:</strong> If you submit an intake request through an embedded form service (e.g., Formspree), your submission is transmitted to that provider.</li>
                <li><strong>Payments:</strong> Payment providers (e.g., PayPal) process your transaction and may send us confirmation details.</li>
                <li><strong>Website hosting:</strong> Our site may be hosted by a static hosting provider (e.g., GitHub Pages), which may log basic technical requests for security/operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Chat tools:</strong> If a chat widget is enabled, that provider may process messages and technical data to deliver the chat functionality.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 class="privacy-h3">Legal disclosures</h3>
              <p>
                We may disclose information if required to comply with law, enforce our agreements, protect rights/safety, or respond to lawful requests.
              </p>

              <h3 class="privacy-h3">Business transfers</h3>
              <p>
                If AuraPro Ads is involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, information may be transferred as part of that transaction.
