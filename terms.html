                Turnaround targets are listed on our Pricing page and generally start on the date of purchase. Timeframes are estimates
                and may vary based on project complexity, AI render times, asset availability, and client responsiveness.

              <p>
                Unless your package explicitly includes revisions, revisions are limited. When revisions are offered, they generally cover
                reasonable changes that align with the original request (e.g., minor text, pacing, or alternate hook), not a full re-brief
                or new concept. Major scope changes may require an additional fee.

                Because our Services include digital creative work and capacity reservation, <strong>all sales are generally final once production begins</strong>.
                If you request a cancellation <em>before</em> production begins, AuraPro Ads may, in its sole discretion, issue a partial refund or credit.
